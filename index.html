            <img src="img/dogs.jpg" alt="Photo of Elizabeth Pedley and her 2 dogs.">
            <p> I grew up in a family of 6 on the southside of Chicago. I played volleyball, swam, and did gymnastics throughout junior high and highschool. I married the <a href="http://sampedley.com">love of my life</a> August 30th 2014. We now live an hour south of Chicago in our beautiful home with our 2 awesome rescue dogs. I enjoy animals, weightlifting, video games, a good ice cream sundae, traveling, and spending time with my husband and dogs. My husband is a very talented Software Engineer and shortly after getting married I started to see all the cool programs he was building and wanted to do the same for myself. I have been slowly learning to program ever since. I have always had a logical mind and enjoyed playing with computers throughout my whole life. I really enjoy programming and learning new technologies and techniques. I built this site so that others can see the cool things I've built.</p>
